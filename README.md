# Learning Data Bases
These are T-SQL scripts created while studying databases in university. I worked with MS SQL Server. University lections are saved in a folder with the corresponding name.

You can find tasks in the file "ПрактикумБазыДанных.doc". You can find solution for each laboratory work in a folder with the corresponding name. 

_*Unfortunately the university database was filled with Russian characters and the encoding could be corrupted, that's why I strongly recommend you to open files with notepad.*_ 

First I learned the basics, then I worked with more complex tools, such as transactions, functions, procedures.
