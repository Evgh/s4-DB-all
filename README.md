# Learning Data Bases
T-SQL scripts created during studying Data Bases subject in university. I worked with MS SQL Server. University lections are saved in corresponding folder.

You can find tasks in file "ПрактикумБазыДанных.doc". You can find solutions for each laboratory work in corresponding folder. For example all solutions for first laboratory work tasks will be in folder s4-db-1. First I learned the basics. Then I worked with more complex tools, such as transactions, functions, procedures.

Unfortunately the university database was filled with Russian characters and the encoding could be corrupted, thats why I strongly recommend you to open files with notepad.
